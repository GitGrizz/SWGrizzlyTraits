# SpartanWeaponry
Weapons Galore! A whole new arsenal of weaponry made for Minecraft.<br>
Inspired by Balkon's WeaponMod, it adds new versions of weapons from that mod, as well expanding the arsenal with a bunch of original weapons, including a variety of swords, polearms, blunt and ranged weapons<br>

Grizz Here, I have little to no clue what i'm doing, but just so you know, i changed some weapon traits using literally no skill, just copying from one weapon to another. Just wanted blocking on the 2 handed weapons given you cant use shields with better combat.<br>
